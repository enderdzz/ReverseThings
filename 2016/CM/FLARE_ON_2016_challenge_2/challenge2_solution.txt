the key in the program used:
"thosefilesreallytiedthefoldertogether" -> len = 37
00401401 | F3 A5                 | rep movs dword ptr es:[edi],dword ptr ds:[esi]        Why have no changes?

CryptDecrypt(HCRYPTKEY hKey, HCRYPTHASH hHash, BOOL Final, DWORD dwFlags, BYTE *pbData, DWORD *pdwDataLen)

"call dword ptr ds:[402008]" this instruction is very important!

To solve this, I do following three steps:
1. Fix the IAT, add the decrypt function of avd**32.dll to IAT;
2. Create a new folder named as "Briefcase" and put the file (which you want to decrypt) into the floder; 
3. Use OD to dynmaically debug :
	1) Need to modify the VolumeSerialNumber;
	2) Need to modify the instruction "call dword ptr <&CryptEncrypt>" to "call dword ptr ds:[402008](<&CryptDecrypt>)";
	
Finally, you will found there are two pictures as .jpg file. And one of them contain the key.
