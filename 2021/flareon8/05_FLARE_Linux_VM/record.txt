OpenSUSE Leap 15.2

In the FLARE language "spaghetti" is "c3BhZ2hldHRp". 
In the FLARE team we like to speak in code. You should learn our language, otherwise you want be able to speak with us when you escape (if you manage to escape!). For example, instead of "strawberries" we say "c3RyYXdiZXJyaWVz".
"ugali", "unagi" and "udon noodles" are delicious. What a coincidence that all of them start by "u"!

We LOVE "Reese's", they are great for everything! They are amazing in ice-cream and they even work as a key for XOR encoding.

Are you good at maths? We love maths at FLARE! We use this formula a lot to decode bytes: "ENCODED_BYTE + 27 + NUMBER1 * NUMBER2 - NUMBER3"

The only problem with RC4 is that you need a key. The FLARE team normally uses this number: "SREFBE" (as an UTF-8 string). If you have no idea what that means, you should give up and bake some muffins.

If this challenge is too difficult and you want to give up or just in case you got hungry, what about baking some muffins? Try this recipe:
0 - Cinnamon

2 - Lemon 1/2
3 - Eggs 3
4 - Sugar 150gr
5 - Flour 250gr
6 - Milk 30gr
7 - Icing sugar 10gr
8 - Apple 100gr
9 - Raspberries 100gr

Mix 0 to 9 and bake for 30 minutes at 180Â°C.
