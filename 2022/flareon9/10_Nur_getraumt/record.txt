Very frustrating challenge. Tooling game!

I've tried many tools, at last it still works only on my own understanding of the 68k disassembly code in ResEdit.
I tried my best to extract the .sit archive from the disk image in disk copy 4.2 format, but failed many times. 
StuffIt Expander did not work either.
I also installed many apps (ImportFl and exportFl) provided from mini vmac site to operate the binary.
Also trying to install MacsBug 6.6.x (.sit or .hqx) into Sheepshaver(MacOS9), BasiliskII and mini vmac(Macintosh), but failed. I see some people worked out by the help of QEMU.
And 

Finally I installed CiderPress (HFVExplorer don't work) in Windows, but it still cannot extract the files in the disk which I converted from original image using convert2dsk. Zero-sized extracted files! Drag the file from OS 9 to host machine folder won't help either. https://superuser.com/questions/96758/copy-files-from-mac-os-9-to-windows-7

So I give up and come back to read the disassembly carefully. During this time, I learned lot about 68k instructions with the PDF 68000.68010.68020.primer, but it don't introduce the GUI traps like _GetIText. Then I found I can copy the hex code in ResEdit from Emulator by chance, I feed the binary into Ghidra which cannot handle the GUI traps instruction either, but it validates my understanding of the logic of decode_flag function anyway.
So the final problem is to find the final key, I noticed that the flag resource named with "99 balloon", it may be a song's name, and the key is guessed from its lyric. I don't like this challenge in the end. Too guessy.
