One of our endpoints was infected with a very dangerous, yet unknown malware
strain that operates in a fileless manner. The malware is - without doubt - an
APT that is the ingenious work of the Cyber Army of the Republic of Kazohinia.

One of our experts said that it looks like they took an existing banking
malware family, and modified it in a way that it can be used to collect and
exfiltrate files from the hard drive.

The malware started destroying the disk, but our forensic investigators were
able to salvage ones of the files. Your task is to find out as much as you can
about the behavior of this malware, and try to find out what was the data that
it tried to steal before it started wiping all evidence from the computer.

Good luck!
