Hello,

 

I’m working an incident response case for Derek Zoolander. He clicked a link and was infected with MugatuWare! As a result, his new headshot compilation GIF was encrypted.

To secure an upcoming runway show, Derek needs this GIF decrypted; however, he refuses to pay the ransom.

 We received an additional encrypted GIF from an anonymous informant. The informant told us the GIF should help in our decryption efforts, but we were unable to figure it out.

 We’re reaching out to you, our best malware analyst, in hopes that you can reverse engineer this malware and decrypt Derek’s GIF.

 I've included a directory full of files containing:


* MugatuWare malware

* Ransom note
 (GIFtToDerek.txt)
* Encrypted headshot GIF (best.gif.Mugatu)

* Encrypted informant GIF (the_key_to_success_0000.gif.Mugatu)





Thanks,
Roy
