    """"+\\n    PROVISIONAL\\n\\n    The API extensions enabled by this policy are currently provisional.\\n    Refer to the documentation for details.\\n\\n    This policy adds new header parsing and folding algorithms.  Instead of\\n    simple strings, headers are custom objects with custom attributes\\n    depending on the type of the field.  The folding algorithm fully\\n    implements RFCs 2047 and 5322.\\n\\n    In addition to the settable attributes listed above that apply to\\n    all Policies, this policy adds the following additional attributes:\\n\\n    utf8                -- if False (the default) message headers will be\\n                           serialized as ASCII, using encoded words to encode\\n                           any non-ASCII characters in the source strings.  If\\n                           True, the message headers will be serialized using\\n                           utf8 and will not contain encoded words (see RFC\\n                           6532 for more on this serialization format).\\n\\n    refold_source       -- if the value for a header in the Message object\\n                           came from the parsing of some source, this attribute\\n                           indicates whether or not a generator should refold\\n                           that value when transforming the message back into\\n                           stream form.

A default header_factory is provided that\\n                           understands some of the RFC5322 header field types.\\n                           (Currently address fields and date fields have\\n                           special treatment, while all other fields are\\n                           treated as unstructured.
